    "text": "I am a landscape ecologist with expertise in the spatial component of ecology and environmental sciences. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Biology from Baker University, a Master’s Degree in Resource Ecology from Duke University, and a Ph. D. in Environmental Science from the University of Rhode Island. Since, May of 2006, I have worked as a Research Ecologist with the US EPA’s Atlantic Ecology Division in Narragansett, RI. My past experience is in applications of geospatial technologies (such as geographic information systems, spatial statistics, and remote sensing) to environmental research and broad scale environmental monitoring, modeling and assessment. Currently, my research focus is on how nutrients drive risk of cyanobacterial blooms in lakes and ponds. A unifying theme to my research is using Open Science (Open Access, Open Source, and Open Data) to benefit environmental science."

In this role, I have developed tools and methodologies (GIS and statistical) using numerous software packages and languages (R, ArcGIS, GRASS, Python, MS Excel) and have continued prior research on technology transfer of data, analytical methods and predictive tools to Northeast States; and developed statistical and modeling tools to facilitate use of defensible techniques in water quality criteria development. Previously I have: served as Co-lead on a project studying ecosystem services related to nutrient cycling in Northeastern lakes and ponds, was the liaison between the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and EPA’s Ecosystem Services Research Program (ESRP), was task lead for our lakes ecosystem services work, and served as co-task lead for developing decision support tools for a project in Narragansett Bay and its watershed.

I have created packages with four on CRAN (quickmapr, lakemorpho, elevatr, and lawn) and several in development on GitHub. I co-moderate (with Sarah Goslee) the R-SIG-Ecology mailing list, and have taught several classes/workshops on R. I am the lead maintainer of rOpenSci’s Maptools CRAN Taskview, I contribute to both the development of lawn: an R client for turf.js and the Reproducibility Guide.\n\n\n\nWeb\n\nAlthough not a web designer, I have served as a web page maintainer for various organizations since ~2000. Currently I maintain my own website and a few small project websites. I use HTML, CSS, Jekyll, Github pages as the primary development environment and I am comfortable coding sites from scratch and have experience implementing templates and frameworks (i.e. Skeleton or Bootstrap). I have limited experience with javascript and in the past have been responsible for limited maintenance of Apache and IIS servers.\n\n\n\nPython\n\nStarting in 2006, I have written Python scripts to interact with ESRI products. Since then, I have also developed many scripts for data management, data collection, interacting with the Twitter API, and communicating with R.\n\n\n\nJava\n\nI have about one year experience with Java, primarily from computer science coursework.\n\n\n\nMisc\n\nI use markdown and Rmarkdown extensively for developing web content, creating reproducible presentations and writing manuscripts. Over the years I have also used a variety of tools for individual projects. These include Visual Basic for Applications, Arc Macro Language, Typo3, Dreamweaver, Movable Type, Drupal, and RApache\n\n\nData Management and Analysis\n\nGIS\n\nSince 2012, I have used R (with sp, rgdal, rgeos, raster, and, since its release, sf) as my primary GIS and spatial analysis platform. The prior 17 years I extensively used the ESRI product line including ArcGIS, Arc/INFO, ArcView, ArcIMS and ArcGIS Server, and Geostatistical Analyst. I have limited experience using GRASS.\n\n\n\nStatistics\n\nMy statistics work has been conducted primarily in R since 2003. I have experience with many many statistical methods including least squares, logistic regression, information theoretic model selection, principal components, multi-dimensional scaling, boosted regression, and Random Forests. In the past I have used SAS, SPSS, SPlus, and SigmaPlot.\n\n\n\nData\n\nI have many years experience managing small to medium-sized research datasets. I have done this using relational databases (Access, SQLite), flat files, and for spatial data, shapefiles, coverages, File Geodatabases, and recently GeoJSON.\n\n\n\nRemote Sensing\n\nI have experience analyzing aerial photography and satellite imagery to develop land use/land cover classifications and used a variety of accuracy assessment methods and approaches. Must of my past remote sensing work was conducted with ERDAS Imagine.\n\n\n\nGPS\n\nI have collected GPS data from a variety of devices including Trimble ProXR, Trimble GeoExplorer, Trimble GeoXT, Garmin Chartplotters, and associated device specific software.\n\n\nOS and Misc\n\nLinux\n\nI use Red Hat (RHEL 6) and Ubuntu daily. I have built and am responsible for system administration on several Ubuntu (12.04 and 14.04) machines.\n\n\n\nWindows\n\nI use Windows (NT/2000/XP/7) daily and am capable of basic systems administration.\n\n\n\nMisc\n\nI have extensive knowledge of Microsoft Office 2000-2013 and have some networking and hardware maintenance experience.\n\n\nResearch Funding\n\n2010 - Present\n\nUSEPA Safe and Sustainable Water Research Program Task 4.01C: A Data Intensive Investigation of Temperature Impacts and Bloom Modelling.
